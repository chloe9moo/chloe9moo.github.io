<p>I am a population and community ecologist with a broad interest in the relationships among species characteristics, the environment, and biological variation, with a conservation angle. My research within this realm pulls from a wide array of disciplines including population genetics, spatial and landscape ecology, traits-based ecology, quantitative ecology, and data science. Generally, I try to learn about a wide range of taxa and ecosystems, but I have a soft spot for freshwater - particularly anything amphibian!</p>

<p>Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Associate at the <a href="https://www.caryinstitute.org/">Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies</a> working with Dr. Chris Solomon and NYSDEC biologists to quantitatively analyze the past and future of Hudson River fisheries using long-term monitoring data. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the <a href="https://danmag.wixsite.com/business-services">Magoulick Lab</a> in the Arkansas Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit working on flow-ecology relationships of fish and aquatic insects in the Interior Highlands region of Arkansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma. I graduated in spring 2023 with a PhD in Biological Sciences from Virginia Tech, advised by <a href="https://www.mimslab.org/">Dr. Meryl Mims</a>. For my dissertation I characterized multidimensional biodiversity in anurans of the USA.</p>

<p>On the life side of work-life balance, I enjoy baking (<i>from sourdough to cookies, sometimes sourdough cookies</i>), reading (<i>sci-fi or fantasy</i>), gaming (<i>board or video</i>), and exploring by running (<i>slowly</i>) and hiking.</p>
